title: Get Aggregated Reporting Data
openapi: post /networks/reporting/entity/table
---

The main endpoint on which you can pivot your data. Each request must contain :

- `from` and `to` dates
- `timezone_id` used for the request. Find all timezones <a href="{{< ref "timezones.md" >}}">here</a>
- `currency_id` used for the reporting metrics
- At least one column

Optional query filters can then be added to the call.

Please note that the endpoint is limited to 10,000 rows. If you hit the limit, response will include `"incomplete_results": true` in the payload. When that's the case, either reduce the number of columns or reduce the scope of the report you are requesting.
